CURRENT NOTES:

- Man.... looking at how in the index.html page, we're calling the files locally, but maybe href vs src. maybe we dont' actually need to host these files... test ... 
- checkout base-templete.html in mf2. Looks like they use a type of "ALL" files loaded in folder
- - ^^^ may be a way to condense code base on index.html?

TO DO:

- Get data-someValue= { 'hello' } figured out. WHY? can you pass dynamic values the way you're doing it??? I know you can like this ...
- review JS, remove junk/examples.
- Can we condense the code by some *All in folder for Riot & semantic files in index.html????
- Fuck it! Let's just make a shitty unsecure login with pubnub. AND/OR: take blocks tutorial to see if you can handle it there.


- Create Dongeon master's in global.
- Put Dongeon Master's link to view on landingPage.
- Create view fighter page with hard coded data.
- - Included add fighter button
- - create modal to pop up for both button on view fighter page AND dropdown.

--- TERMINAL GUIDE TO RIOT.JS ---

- cd to tags folder inside
- cd desktop
- cd github
- cd lab
- cd TI-83-RPG

- riot -w tags tags/all.js // this will watch any .tag file and auto compile...

....But... more specificlaly....
-> riot tags/hello-form.tag // This will compile the file into a .js of the same name
-> riot -w tags all.js // this will watch and update ANY .tag file into all.js
