Using JavaScript, any JS and CSS library, the JSON structure defined
in camp_features.js and the initial template file campground.html,
please reveal the top level camp features as a <ul> list, and indicate
whether or not each feature is present at this campground.

Clicking on a feature should reveal its sub-features, if they're present or
not, and so on.

The presence or absence of each feature may be indicated with an icon, a
different color, or both. Feel free to make it look great!

Each <li> element should be a bubble that's clickable in case there are
sub-features to reveal. Sub-features should be displayed in a nested <ul> list.
