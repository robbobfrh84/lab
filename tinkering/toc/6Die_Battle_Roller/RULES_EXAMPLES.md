# Rules
Each Player starts with 3 dice whose value is associated with attributes. 
- All 6 dice are rolled.
- Find the die with the lowest value
- Remove that die from the game!
- ? Are there more than one die with the lowest value ?
  - If the tied dice are all from the same side, remove the die with the lowest roll value, so a d6 rolls 1 and a d10 rolls 1, remove the d6.
  - Set those die aside as if they didn't exist.
    - If only one side is represented remaning, put the set aside die back and roll again. 
  - If both sides are represented, find the lowest die from the remaining die.
