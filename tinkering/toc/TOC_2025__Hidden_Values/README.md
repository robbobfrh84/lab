# Where I left off
- Finished raw basic flow for selecting charactoers 
- The below to do is outdata and needs to be updated
- but we're ready to create a new `match.js` file and start bringing the logic for the char battles. 

# To Do 

`Match` outline
- body max with 600px (keep aligned left)
- Title: TOC 2025 - Hidden Values --- match
- Settings section (maybe small label)
  - Google Sheet Url Link
- 2x centered dropdown menu
- stylized divider: `-------- vs --------`

`Match` User Flow
- Click a dropdown ("Select Top Character"), 
- Reveal input and button list of all Characters 
- autofocus on input and pull up text on mobile
- A list of all Characters is shown (modal style)
- Typing filters list
- Select a Character: click / Tap.
- row where dropdown was is now a fill flex row with name, region, sex, record
- Reveal Point Box: once both characters are selected 
  - Name on left, five Green circles on right, centered
  - 2x Flex rows. 
- Reveal BoxScore Box: once both characters are selected

`/Details` (After a couple test spars to build history)
