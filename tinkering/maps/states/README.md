# US States Thematic Map Builder
Building an interactive US states map for blog posts.

### To Do ðŸŸ¡ âœ… ðŸš¨
- âœ… Create CSS & JS file
- âœ… Clean up code for what we're doing, ignore `highlight_click_show` specifics.
- âœ… ? Remove all state's `fill="#5C5D60"` in states_svg.jg
- âœ… Create a white submask for each state.
- âœ… Change states and bg color. Should be different, but maybe both on gray scale.
- âœ… Set border radius and drop shaddow 
- âœ… Decide on background color & State color.
- âœ… test out grainy background. maybe only water?
- âœ… Disable clicking borders. 
- âœ… Remove DC 
- âœ… Decide on a max width.
- Settle on mobile margins and padding.
- Zoom Browser: ? How do I wanna handle this?
- Zoom Mobile: ? How do I wanna Handle this?
- User story: Think about this before jumping into thoughts on different colors
  - Onload: User just wants to click a state and see what happens. 
  - So maybe we have a "default"("green") group that starts to populate as you click.
  - Even hover could have a "hover"-bar that shows basic info about the state. 

Unordered
- Damn, we need State Lable/abbreviations. 
- Create browser tab icon & Review Tab Title still matches.
