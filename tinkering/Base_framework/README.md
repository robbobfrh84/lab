# Base Framework
Experimenting with Vinella JS framework.
- What could be next is handling a request + nested request with looped Components.
- ... That would mean you'd need to handle 

`Render()`: Sets up an experiental approach to dynamically adding onX functions (onClick, onMouseMove,etc)
- However, it isn't yet set up to handle the arguments. 
- Could just say, Hey, gotta setup `this.` vars

`Update()`: updates all data with `<data name"data.age"><data>`
- we should hanlde elmId's here, AND, only update if different. so a check first should be done.  
- Or, should this just be dynamic? meaning update specific values that are updated?
