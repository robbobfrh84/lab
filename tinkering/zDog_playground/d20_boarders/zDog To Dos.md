# To Dos âœ… ðŸŸ¡ (dissovle to dnd_dice when finished, or when you want)
!!!! Where i left off. I used LLM to mark the points to draw paths individually instead of polygon. This seems to work 100% with the border. But when I tried to apply it to a cone effect (don't need to necissarly do this. COULD go back to smaller and smaller boarder) the math seemed off. Like it looks like maybe we need to ask Copilot. 
- You just need to grab line 60-63 and think about what math you need done and ask copilot.
