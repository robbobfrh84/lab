### Previously On...

- ⚠️ The dodeahedron on history isn't cut off. it's just an illution.

### To Do ✅ 🟠 🟡
Post d12
- Now, we can start to move over the new d12..
- Update Scale to be dynamic like it is on d12...

Misc...
- List what you did with number and to To Done below.
- Need to rescale like your number and demos on codepen
  - See if this removes the need for mobile boolean?
- Probable ok to now have a toolkit.js for all math vars `const TAU` etc...

Initial zDog setup
- Finish Select Die from Menu
- Clear out all 'vars' in all dice & a bit review.
- Copy and rename dnd_dice_shape_only and save in zDog_playground (good ref. 4 later)
- Prep next Tasks (Don't have to stick to following order either)

Add D10
- Plan...

Adding UI for testing
- Finish events and `devNotes` for `down_Click_Tap` `up_click_tap`
  - Test on mobile
  - rename as appropriot
  
Add Rotate to number testing
- Look at `test_dodecahedron_goTo` & REALLY think what you need to be building.

Add Numbers to dice
- Plan...

Roll Effect
- Plan...

Touch UP
- Maybe use createElement on history build.
- Add tab Icon
- Canvas zDog eliments are slightly larger in mobile. CSS? or need a isMobile?
