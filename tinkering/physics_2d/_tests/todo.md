### Where I Left Off
-

# TO DO ‚úÖ üü° üü†
‚úÖ fromVertices in `_core_examples`
- ‚úÖ Review Body.js, re-order with an SVG section, rest at top in cronological order.
- ‚úÖ new method for `adjustSVGpoints`

- Update `### Where I Left Off` 
- PUSH AGAIN 

`svg_D_paths_curved` in `_core_examples`
- get working for matter x,y
- get working for matter ox,oy
- create 3 different angled ramp

`polygon_and_trapezoids`
- https://brm.io/matter-js/docs/classes/Bodies.html

`circle_and_rectangles`
- https://brm.io/matter-js/docs/classes/Bodies.html

`rounded_corners` ("chamfer") in `_core_examples` 
- already have empty rounded_courners in matter_js_demos
- https://brm.io/matter-js/demo/#rounded

`borders_rounded_courners` in `_core_examples`
- create rounded courners and make option for borders, give all 4 courners as arr.
- Here's where you also make option to `outset` borders.

`borders_and_backgrounds` in `_core_examples`
- simple example without rounded corners

Start Snowman! zones & other elements get built in as best you can. 
- Build in `_tests`, this will be an example. but IGNOR updating framework!
- create readme outline and include (`# update Physic 2D lib`)
- clean out this `todo.md`
- Update what else should be done for `v1.1`

Refactor
- I feel like there's some code that can be moved to `tookit.js`. review and move.

Cleanup / Breakup _core_examples. Individual `config.js`, etc... 
- ‚õÑÔ∏è Needed for snowman game 
  - ‚öôÔ∏è complete_config
  - üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è avatars. 
    - 6x - Svg & matter - Three `<<avatar>>` #local, #url, default
  - üü© circles_&_squares
    - demo "over" scale
    - try for `<g></g>` groups and adding shadow layer. 
    - offset svg examples. (make sure to note x,y vs. oX,oY)
    - JUST ONE example for matter, the original box.png overscale. 
üü° -‚õÑÔ∏è üî∂ other_shapes
  - üí† all svg shapes (Keep simple. Need a complex ref? >see shapes detailed example)
  - üß± static_bodies
    - include svg examples
    - ramps_&_rounded_courners
  - üñºÔ∏è backgrounds_and_shadow_layers
    - Make walls offset
    - Add textures
    - Add Drop shaddow inset to background
    - Add curved Object to put in courners (don't add to wall object, that's to specific)
      - Add to walls:`insetCurve: 10` (for all walls, anything else, just use static bodies)
  - üåã moving_static_bodies
  - ‚òÑÔ∏è options explore
  -‚õÑÔ∏è ü™ü tracking_zone_events
  -?‚õÑÔ∏è üç° binding_bodies_in_motion: https://brm.io/matter-js/demo/#collisionFiltering
- Remove unused images. 


Create new `_test` called `width_height_scale` (This is a bit of a tinker)
- So... hight isn't 0-100 meaning x: 50, y: 50 isn't centered if 2/3 ratio. Think about how best to fix this. Could just handle "h" by ratio and might work. 
- Set up an easy toggle between 600 v 1200, etc. 
- If the window allows for 1000x1000, they physics will behave differently. I think the fix for this is to lock in a width, 600, 1000, 1200? Then use `transform: scale()` to match window width. 

Development helper UI
- But it'd be really nice to have a mouse over that gives you x,y for pixels, percentages and then if you click an object you get relative location...

Cleanup
- Should "options" be "render" just so that it matches Matter terminology?
- Let's review all the example and only have what is needed for use-cases/tests

### To DOCUMENT
- Rectangles
  - Explain how they're fitted to matter js, i.e. x,y,w,h...
  - How they're built center out, rather than right-> like svgs. 
- SVG don't use `options.resize` do manually in svg element.
  - Use the same 0-100 and it'll be scaled. 
  - Remember Rectangles are built differently.
  - Within the actualy SVG ELM...
    - Use `oX="-3" oY="2"` when you want to offset relative to x,y
    - YOU CAN directly put in x,y but it'll just be harder to head math the locations.
- Notes on scaling matter canvas (git branch `higher-resolution-tester`)
  - "fixes blurry and fussy lines for matter layers" etc...
  - I messed around with this a bit, and discovered that while possible (see branch), the downside is that it changes the physics, meaning the numbers that build the physics are built into the pixel size it seems. 

#### Un-Ordered To Do (? Maybe move to later MVP!?)

# Physics 2d Library

### üü° MVP - Basic Setup: 
- ‚úÖ `#url` images for avatar.
- layers
- zone tracking
- backgournds
- curve static
- Move v1.1 to dependency_versions
- ü¶ã POST: Curate and post ramp example with basic backgrounds. 

### MVP - Expand and clean up `_tests` & BASIC Documentation
- Add `index.html` to root level of tests. simple links to all `_tests`
- Move `physics_2d_v1.1` out of `_core_examples`. We do want to share
- When we add changes to the libs, we create a new folder (`c/p`) and incremient
- THEN, we can switch each test over one-by-one as we test üòú.
- Or: keep the same structure we have? Either way...üëá This MVP thinks this out. 
- Add `README.md` and explain work flow and gotach (`### Jumping Back In?`)
  - Add `### How SVGs are rendered to Matter`
    - "the object" MUST have shape match. 
- Review `physics_2d/README.md` to reflect changes.

### MVP - ODD balls (start in projects)
- Create new `_test` > `rotating_complex_object`

### MVP - Complex objects 
- Matter.Bodies >`{rectangle: ∆í, trapezoid: ∆í, circle: ∆í, polygon: ∆í, fromVertices: ∆í}`

### MVP+ (Needs MVP home)
- Image Drag and drop Box - to update avatar image. 
- Re-evaluating walls:
  - Negative thickness i.e.(`= -2`) on rectanges seems to be visually 0 BUT has effect!
  - However, setting `=0` seems to break matter and not show up OR take effect.
  - Also, should we add `negThickness:10` to build into empty space to stop fast object?
- resize event? this might be problamatic.. or super easy. lol. 

Tests (`_tests`)
- Bounce box in circle. Tests max object load with 1. svgs, 2. images, 3.r aw objects

### MVP++ "Wait for usecase" / "Daydreams" & "Down the Road"...

Wait for usecase...
- Add a layer type `html`? Just build around a `<div>` instead of an `<svg>`. 
  - Usecases: .gifs, Complex UI üí°(moving control panel) Even whole svgs embed.
- Convert to Progressive Web App (PWA) 
  - chatGPT guide: https://chatgpt.com/c/673e378a-5aec-8002-ac19-bf226b70abfc

# Example Post Ideas...

### "Ramp", rounded_corners
- avatar rolls down a ramp into a column of blocks 

### "Moving Static Bodies"
- Polygon that can be modified by points, 3(tryange), 4, 5, 6,.. 8(octogon)
  - `<` & `>` external muttons add/remove points, min 3, max 20,  
  - And this rotates and can be controlled by additional `<` & `>` buttons.
- And, under a Button press flicks a body like a pin-ball paddle. (static?)
