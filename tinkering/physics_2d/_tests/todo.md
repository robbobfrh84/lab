### Where I Left Off
- 

# TO DO âœ… ðŸŸ¡ ðŸŸ 

## `_tests/_overview`
- âœ… Convert to `physics_2d` & âœ… rename `_core_examples`
- âœ… Fixed layer blocking issues
- âœ… switch to 100% & add Max-width
- âœ… Set hight to be determined by ratios. 
- âœ… fix walls, make sure they match 0-100 scaling
- âœ… startingGravity to `Config`
- Svgs ELEMENT attributes need to be resized, BUT maybe do it real quick, then put all resizing in one method. It's confusing scattered out, and we should just loop through everything that needs to be resized first. 
- ðŸŸ¡ Make custom 0-100 Range for all bodies 
- `'circle'` -> `'cir'` ? in config file
- root name still need to change to physics_2d

- Extend `Helper` to add `Helper_Bodies.js`. 
  - Should we create `Body.js` It wouldn't be much. 

- Let's setup dyanmic layer tracking for svg. (see tourdefrance in shed)

- Ok, avitar needs to be SVG! and use #<url>!
- PUSH! ligit push with comment

- COPY/PASTE `/physics_2d_v1.1` -> `/_dependency_versions`
- review all code for notes / cleanup.
- PUSH! ligit push with comment

#### Un-Ordered To Do (maybe punt to later MVP)
- Add basic static block with `html` mask
- Add button to basic static block with html that remove the matter & overlay.
- Add basic static curve

- Walls and Backgrounds
  - Add Texture to background
  - Add texture to walls
  - Add Drop shaddow inset to background
  - Add to walls:`insetCurve: 10` (for all walls, anything else, just use static bodies)
- Mask walls - simple textures (add the 5 we have and test)

- resize event? ()
- Convert to Progressive Web App (PWA) 
  - chatGPT guide: https://chatgpt.com/c/673e378a-5aec-8002-ac19-bf226b70abfc

- Info
  - negative thickness (-) on rectanges seems to be visually 0 BUT has effect!
  - However, setting =0 seems to break matter and not show up OR take effect

# Physics 2d Library

### MVP (prep for Odd balls)
- `#url` images should work.

### MVP + 1
- Add a layer type 'html'? I think it'd be pretty easy, just build around a `<div>` instead of an `<svg>`
- Consider adding a "demo" changer from a list in a menu popup. use US Maps component.
  - Then, create a folder inside `_core_examples` of `/configs` so we can toggle through different examples easy. 
- Drag and drop to update avatar image. 
- Create a `_DOCs.md` that has all config settings and options layed out. 

- Fast moving objects escape body. Look into matter js for a way to handle this.
  - Fall back to just making the wall exists in negative space a bunch.

`_core_examples` menu toggle tests to add.
  - Bounce box demoing mass and multi-bodies objects.

### MVP++ Daydreams & Down the Road...

# Example Post Ideas...

### "Ramp", rounded_corners
- avatar rolls down a ramp into a column of blocks 

### "Moving Static Bodies"
- Polygon that can be modified by points, 3(tryange), 4, 5, 6,.. 8(octogon)
  - Ok to be hard coded. 
- Button press on level flicks like a pin-ball paddle. But this object is static.
