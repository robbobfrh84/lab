# Fraction Reducer

This project is a fraction reducer that allows users to input a numerator and denominator and get the most reduced fraction as the output.

## Project Structure

The project has the following files:

- `src/index.html`: This file is the HTML file that contains the user interface. It includes two input fields for the numerator and denominator, as well as an "Enter" button.

- `src/styles.css`: This file is the CSS file that contains the styles for the user interface. It can be used to customize the appearance of the input fields and button.

- `src/app.js`: This file is the JavaScript file that contains the logic for reducing the fraction. It listens for the "Enter" button click event, retrieves the values from the input fields, reduces the fraction using a function, and displays the most reduced fraction to the user.

- `package.json`: This file is the configuration file for npm. It lists the dependencies and scripts for the project.
