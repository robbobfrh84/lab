### Tester MVP
- Basic Setup
  - even if clunky / `testy()` set up with 1 **ball** and 1 **block** and **walls**
- Mask walls - simple textures (add the 5 we have and test)
- Size, Scale and presets
  - Everything is set to a percent! 0,0 to 100x100
  - Three styles: Portrait(16:9), Landscape(9:16), and Square(1:1)
  - Then, set width/height in pixels { w:800, h:'p' } h can be portrait, landscape, or square
    - Can be set either way. 
- Mask walls - add - drop shaddow
- Mask walls - add - Curved inset and shaddow
