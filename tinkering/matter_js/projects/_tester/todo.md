### TO DO âœ… ðŸŸ¡
- Don't you just wanna make it a square? like, think about it. Why not just hardcode the width / hight or, set a max. idk... i'm chashing my tail on this. 

### Tester MVP
- âœ… Just get it working from `drop_on_blocks`
- Build mask... Make embed option
  - maybe `maskImage`, or `embedImage` Option...?

Un-Ordered
- Mask walls - simple textures (add the 5 we have and test)
- Size, Scale and presets
  - Everything is set to a percent! 0,0 to 100x100
  - Three styles: Portrait(16:9), Landscape(9:16), and Square(1:1)
  - Then, set width/height in pixels { w:800, h:'p' } h can be portrait, landscape, or square
    - Can be set either way. 
- matter_walls - add - Curved inset -   matter_walls: { w: 10, innerRadius: 10 },
- matter_walls - add - Curved inset and shaddow (border radius!!)
- Mask walls - add - drop shaddow
- Mask walls - add - Example of "Frills" Designs in corners (Like bike one.)
