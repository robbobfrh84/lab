# How I think this works as a  âœ¨ Post-a-long âœ¨
- Find a demo you wanna toy with: https://brm.io/matter-js/demo 
- Copy the code you wanna use and make sure it works as a demo in the `demos` folder.
- Add anything new `_tester` app, translated to your example.
- Then, create your own fun example using it in `projects` (may use multiple demos)
- move your example to the `/posts` folder and **post**. 

# To Do âœ… ðŸŸ¡
"Drop on Blocks"
- âœ… Get Sprites working
- âœ… Build and post "Drop on Block"
- âœ… Create a new folder to host: `bob.farm/posts/drop_on_block#earth_to_bob_`
- âœ… Post Thread. âœ… Follow up post with you playing with it more.
- Review code and make POA. 


Create `projects/_Template`
- I think we need an app.js. 
  - Maybe not onload.js, that can be on index.html
  - Or, a css file. just a 
- The sprites is really annoying. probablly a production level thing, but not for these fun toys where we need easy copy / paste images...

# Example Post Ideas

### "Drop on Blocks": sprites
- Use the Sprites example and add an avatar and your own box image
- Use 4x different colors
- Stack them in a column so when the avatar drops it tplles it over slowely
- Add A border { SQUARE } **we'll lean about rounded in another post**. 
- Add background... just grainy gray?

### "ramp", rounded_corners
- avatar rolls down a ramp into a column of blocks
