# ðŸ˜Š Welcome to 2d_physics Development Lab ðŸ§«

# Workflow
- See: `/todo_and_ideas.md` for top-level todos and ideas. 
- See: `/_tests/todo.md` for test in project development. 
  - Also: `/_tests/_overview` is where the code/structure/stratagies are best explained and explored. 
  - And: several tests will give you a better "getting started" idea for a new project/test.

### Adding Proof of Concepts from online sources?
- Find a demo you wanna toy with: https://brm.io/matter-js/demo 
- Copy the code you wanna use and make sure it works as a demo in the `demos` folder.
  - Don't need to break it up in that folder, just make sure it works as originally written in the example link above - check for assets, etc...
- Add any new usecases to `_tests` app, 
  - Translated into our structure as a standalone Proof of Concept.
- Then, create your own fun example using it in `projects`.
- move your example to the `/posts` folder and **post**. 

### Posting your Proof of Concepts?
This can work great as a Development âœ¨ Post-a-long âœ¨
- move your example to the `/posts` folder and **post**. 
- make sure all the files it needs exist in folder (copy/past if needed)

### Got a Project ideas ready?
- Just copy/paste from `_tests` & create new folder in `projects`
- Them, if you're keeping this project in the project folder. 
  - Move your example to the `/posts` folder and **post**. 
  - AND, make sure all the files it needs exist in folder (copy/past if needed)
