# How I think this works as a  âœ¨ Post-a-long âœ¨
- Find a demo you wanna toy with: https://brm.io/matter-js/demo 
- Copy the code you wanna use and make sure it works as a demo in the `demos` folder.
- Then, create your own fun example using it in `projects`
- If youo use an additional example. Just add that to `demos` and include in current project.
- Sometimes you'l add a few demos. Sometimes maybe none now!

# To Do âœ… ðŸŸ¡
"Drop on Blocks"
- âœ… Get Sprites working
- ðŸŸ¡ Build and post "Drop on Block"
- Create a new folder to host 
  - ? `bob.farm/posts/drop_on_block#earth_to_bob_`
  - ? `tobob.earth/drop_on_block#earth_to_bob_`
- Post Thread. 
  - Follow up post with you playing with it more
  - HERE's A CRAZY idea, create a short youtube vid... maybe adding another person and playing with it....????

Create `projects/_Template`
- I think we need an app.js. 
  - Maybe not onload.js, that can be on index.html
  - Or, a css file. just a 
- The sprites is really annoying. probablly a production level thing, but not for these fun toys where we need easy copy / paste images...

# Example Post Ideas

### "Drop on Blocks": sprites
- Use the Sprites example and add an avatar and your own box image
- Use 4x different colors
- Stack them in a column so when the avatar drops it tplles it over slowely
- Add A border { SQUARE } **we'll lean about rounded in another post**. 
- Add background... just grainy gray?

### "ramp", rounded_corners
- avatar rolls down a ramp into a column of blocks
