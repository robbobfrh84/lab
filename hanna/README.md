  - make background buzz like a 1 min. clip. 
  - thoughtfully figure out resonable solution for resst
- Set up dev env for mobile. 
  - Find the hot reload so you aren't 'jumping through hoops' testing
  - figure how to get logs 
- Try the Osolater thingy: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68054650/web-audio-volume-fade-for-ios-13-devices

Info Page
- Start by writing it out in "Starting Sequence"
