# Where It's At
- Mobile ~~~~ FIGURE OUT PLAN
  - 

# Next 3 âœ… ðŸŒ•... 
- finish trimming tracks
- Photoshop sparkles. 

# To Do âœ… ðŸŒ•

ðŸŒ•Mobile Fly & Return(test)
  - NEED TO figure out tap drag and click, because you're a CAT CHASING IT"S TAIL
  - Ideas...
    - I kinda like a swipe, that would be the hardest. 
    - OR double tap with like .5 sec required delay. 

audio
- Add hanna "oooooOOOOoooo" sound effect for sparkles
- Trim audios
- start by having all bees out of screen.
- then fly in one by one with sound.  
- add sound effect
  - 4x individual resting bee sounds
  - struggling (hover) bee sound
  - hanna sigh sound.
  - hanna 'oh' when return. 

Sparkles
- photoshop 
- make hanna "ooooOOOOoooo" sound effect 
- Randomly place over image (minus 5-10%), add 1 every like .2s fadin/out over 1s for like 3-4s. fade all out? bees come back!
- End with "oh" sound effect. 

Starting sequence
- Make "Click/Tap to enter dynamic
- Add fade-in / out effect
- Let's stack "Click/Top to" as smaller font above "enter" with dividing line.

Info Page
- Start by writing it out in "Starting Sequence"
- Then, you can opacity 0 it. and cross fade like on start but then fade the info in...

Finalize
- test on mobile

After done
- Create code pen 
- Send to hanna (ask if i can posts a gif / video)
- IG Post (GIF and live link & credit hanna (link to both images) )
- twitter post with live and codepen link 
  - follow up with IG link in replies (message - 'i'm here now too')
