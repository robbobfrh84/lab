### Where I Left Off...
* Ok. it dosn't make sence to have `_setDivCanvas` have multiple grids.
  * you just lose your ability to create unique sets. make it singulare andlook over the call instead.  

### 3-step
* ADD: "view" func on "accounts" to go to "appends" of post, even if empty.

### To-Do
* BUG: auto clear/save create page for clone, update, post and just reg. "create"
* Add view append *if* it has some
* Add append page with initial post displayed and all apends at that level.
* create a wire-frame box for galery thumbs. will make stand out more.
* re-style create and append to have a more "set"/decided feel.

### Sprint
* Curate create page only for initial append... 1
* Clean code, test
* Create clone for Matt to play with
* email Matt
* Update this .md

### Down the Road
* Start building recursive
* Edit appends-create page to handle moves
* fill button for create
* clear all button for create
* transparent button.
* move blks from one post to other/combine posts before append.
* create clipboard 5-10  or so to drag/drop.
