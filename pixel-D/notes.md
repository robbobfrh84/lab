### Bug
* Click edit, go to another page, click CREATE, you're stuck in edit...

### To-Do
* Add view append *if* it has some
* Add append page with initial post displayed and all apends at that level.

### Sprint
* Change ddb for transparent
* Curate create page only for initial append... 1
* Clean code, test
* Create clone for Matt to play with
* email Matt
* Update this .md

### Down the Road
