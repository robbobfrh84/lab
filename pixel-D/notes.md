### Where I Left Off...
*

### 3-step
* Jump back into Append
  * Create: When submit of new append, create new column with id name
  * Update: original "post" with id
* Fix auto clear/save create page for clone, update, post and just reg. "create"

### Bug

### To-Do
* Add view append *if* it has some
* Add append page with initial post displayed and all apends at that level.

### Sprint
* Change ddb for transparent
* Curate create page only for initial append... 1
* Clean code, test
* Create clone for Matt to play with
* email Matt
* Update this .md

### Down the Road
* Start building recursive
* Edit appends-create page to handle moves
