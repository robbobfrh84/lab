### Where I Left Off...
* lost my mind

### 3-step
* ⚠️ DO WE NEED DELAY????
* Add / Fix: grid move/4,9,16 on create
* Review/ Update/ Plan "Sprint and "down the road"

### To-Do
page_appends / page_showcase:
* CHECK: delay needed for 87 after all our changes?
* STYLE: appends page parent
  * remove [view appends (2)] button.
  * make more obvious.

page_accounts:
* ADD: appends section in accounts.
* ADD: view append *if* it has some, *else* have the btn, just gray.
* ADD: create a wire-frame box for galery thumbs. will make stand out more.
* REFACTOR: hard-code css *if* possible.

page_create:
* ADD: Post new Append! careful with ddb!
* ADD: clear button below swatch.
* REFACTOR: re-style create and create_append to have a more "set"/decided feel.

### Sprint
* maybe: have `_clickArt` save a global version of blk that can be drag/dropped into *other* post grid areas. canvases.
* Clean code, test
* Create clone for Matt to play with
* email Matt
* Update this .md

### Down the Road
* Start building recursive
* Edit appends-create page to handle moves
* fill button for create
* clear all button for create
* transparent button.
* move blks from one post to other/combine posts before append.
* create clipboard 5-10  or so to drag/drop.
