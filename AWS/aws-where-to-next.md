next steps for things to learn and build on

##### Questions
Endpoints? how to implement for user flow?
- in the cognitoUser instance     
  - "isGlobalEndpoint": false,

Email list
- how to send an email to all your users in pools?
- how to handle and organize those lists (thinking mine-shaft-gap)

### Interesting/Check out
