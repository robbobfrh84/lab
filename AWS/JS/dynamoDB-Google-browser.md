# Facebook
Started this tutorial after finishing dynamoDB-FB-browser.html. It may be required to go through that before this if there's confusion. Its going to be much more breif that other markdown files here.

Following: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/google.html
- Started from scratch @ Javascript start with Google. with the JS google+ code from: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/config-web-identity-examples.html
- make sure to add localhost:8080 to your google dev console. There were two places I had to add it. not sure if both were need, i think i'll experiment more when i try to add a real url.

Just go this working. past tutorials cover things that will need to be problem solved out of this. but I got to the point where I could log in with my google id, so that's enough for now.

Most basic additions from here
- Get pic and show it.
- add log out.
- add to combined user pool with info (just like fb)
