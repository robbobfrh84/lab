# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a vanilla JavaScript web app project that implements a tic-tac-toe game with three difficulty settings. The app has a modern style and a mobile-friendly design. It prompts the user to select the difficulty settings, randomly determines who goes first, and then plays the game. The app also alerts the user if the game ends in a tie, win, or loss. The styling uses a nice red-themed color palette.

## Usage

To play the tic-tac-toe game, open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The game board will be displayed along with the difficulty settings. Select the desired difficulty level and click the "Start Game" button. The game will randomly determine who goes first and display the result at the end of the game.

## Development

To modify or enhance the game, you can edit the following files:

- `src/index.html`: This file contains the HTML structure of the web app. You can modify the layout or add new elements as needed.

- `src/scripts/app.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code for the tic-tac-toe game. You can modify the game logic or add new features using vanilla JavaScript.

- `src/styles/style.css`: This file contains the CSS styles for the web app. You can modify the styles to customize the appearance of the game board and other elements.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the code to create your own version of the tic-tac-toe game.
