### Setup

For each example.
- $`cd` into the project folder, then into the "node" folder.
- Run > $`node app.js`
  - NOTE: node is set to use port `8080`
- THEN, `cd ../client`
- Run > $`lr-http-server -p 8000`
  - Make sure you're on a different port than node is running on.

The command `arp -a` will show you what ip address is being used on your local server.
