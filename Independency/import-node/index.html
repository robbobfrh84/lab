<!--
*** WARNING: must cd to same dir as > index.html >>> http-server -c-1 : got to Local 8080 to work.
  - ALSO, you can >>> http-server -c-1 -p 8010 <<< will change port to 8010. Somtimes there's  confict for some reason.

*** NEXT THREE STEPS ***
- create standalone JS file called first called routes.js
  - you need this, because that fucntion you got from the demo is like 7 lines long and should be 1 called from a js file that's already been loaded. also, that file can handle routs.
- create third page
- make third page display / hide on click

*** GOALS ... Notes***
- make list of simple goals.
  - Navbar: with page Home, A & B
    - highlight page
  - Landing: with heading
  - Page A: heading with status component
  - Page B: heading with 2x status components
  - Status Compontent:
    - shows what page your on. has input field with message that can change and update, carriest though whatever page your on.
  - Routing for home, pageA, pageB
  - will need to check on gh-pages to make sure router links work.

.... I really think there's not much more than the basics we can do here ... this, htmlJS and both together really something to drive them. I think you'll be ready rather soon to do your first solid shell concept.
