# canvas3D

A simple html canvas library to render 3D onto 2D canvas.

This library is not build for performance, but rather simple 3D demonstrations and snippets with ability to change perspective.

Though applications may vary, this library was inspired by the desire to render .geojson vectors for a map-like perspective of all open-source and publicly available geospatial data. And, not rely on separate/private APIs and services.

### Future Features
- Add this.groups and have that be a fixed order. 'Might' solve most your rendering issues.
- Zoom
- modify tilting issue to tilt in relation to rendered location, not OG location.
